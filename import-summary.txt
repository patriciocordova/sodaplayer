ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Risky Project Location:
-----------------------
The tools *should* handle project locations in any directory. However,
due to bugs, placing projects in directories containing spaces in the
path, or characters like ", ' and &, have had issues. We're working to
eliminate these bugs, but to save yourself headaches you may want to
move your project to a location where this is not a problem.
C:\Users\AndrÃ©s\Documents\U of T\AndroidProjects\sodaplayer1
                           -  -                             

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* README.md
* SodaplayerSample\
* SodaplayerSample\.project
* SodaplayerSample\AndroidManifest.xml
* SodaplayerSample\ic_launcher-web.png
* SodaplayerSample\libs\
* SodaplayerSample\libs\android-support-v4.jar
* SodaplayerSample\proguard-project.txt
* SodaplayerSample\project.properties
* SodaplayerSample\res\
* SodaplayerSample\res\drawable-hdpi\
* SodaplayerSample\res\drawable-hdpi\ic_launcher.png
* SodaplayerSample\res\drawable-mdpi\
* SodaplayerSample\res\drawable-mdpi\ic_launcher.png
* SodaplayerSample\res\drawable-xhdpi\
* SodaplayerSample\res\drawable-xhdpi\ic_launcher.png
* SodaplayerSample\res\drawable-xxhdpi\
* SodaplayerSample\res\drawable-xxhdpi\ic_launcher.png
* SodaplayerSample\res\values-v11\
* SodaplayerSample\res\values-v11\styles.xml
* SodaplayerSample\res\values-v14\
* SodaplayerSample\res\values-v14\styles.xml
* SodaplayerSample\res\values\
* SodaplayerSample\res\values\strings.xml
* SodaplayerSample\res\values\styles.xml
* SodaplayerSample\src\
* SodaplayerSample\src\info\
* SodaplayerSample\src\info\sodapanda\
* SodaplayerSample\src\info\sodapanda\sodaplayersample\
* SodaplayerSample\src\info\sodapanda\sodaplayersample\MainActivity.java
* build_android.sh
* ic_launcher-web.png
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* jni\ => app\src\main\jni\
* libs\armeabi-v7a\libffmpeg.so => app\src\main\jniLibs\armeabi-v7a\libffmpeg.so
* libs\armeabi\libffmpeg.so => app\src\main\jniLibs\armeabi\libffmpeg.so
* libs\x86\libffmpeg.so => app\src\main\jniLibs\x86\libffmpeg.so
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
